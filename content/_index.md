# Hi there, my name is Anjan. I'm a software engineer with a passion for building open source public good software.

I have 5yrs+ of experience working as a software engineer mostly in Open Source. When i'm not working i occassionaly go for bike trips and play with my dog!

Some of the projects i am currently working on as part of my day job:

* [OpenShift Local (CRC)](https://github.com/crc-org)
* [Qemu for Podman on MacOS](https://github.com/containers/podman-machine-qemu)


I'm a huge believer in Open Source. I was lucky to start my career working for an Open Source Company.

I volunteer for some local Open Source efforts on the side:

* I sometimes administer debian systems for [Free Software Community Of India](https://fsci.org.in).
